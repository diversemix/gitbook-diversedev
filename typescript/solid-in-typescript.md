# SOLID in TypeScript

## Introduction

This course has been written to try and encapsulate what we think is a good approach to software design and implementation on a number of open source projects we are about to undertake. There is the assumption that you will know and have used JavaScript and TypeScript. 

The aim of this course is to walk you through the reasons why certain approaches are taken to improve the code the we will be using. Hopefully you will find this useful and it will help writing code with other developers. None of it is new and all of it is adopted as good practice.

The first lesson, "Lesson Zero" is there just to show you around the example code. This is then followed by two main sections; the first section are lessons one, two and three which are general principles before the section each lesson based on the 5 SOLID principles.

One caveat... This repository has been built to make it easy to follow the lessons. It's not an example of a production setup or environment.

## Lesson Zero

{% hint style="info" %}
AIM: Understand the example you will be using throughout these lessons

[Either use your browser to navigate the code or clone the repository](https://github.com/diversemix/solid)
{% endhint %}

* Take a look at the `message-store/src` folder, start by looking at the interface in `types.ts`
* See if you can guess the implementation just by looking at the interfaces.
* Look at the implementation in `message-store.ts`
* Looking at the sample in `index.ts` see if you can guess the output.
* Now run the example by executing `make run` from inside the `message-store` folder.

It would be good to discuss and/or list out the improvements that could be made to this code and why. We are going to go through improving this code throughout the lessons and hopefully you will 

## Lesson One

{% hint style="info" %}
AIM: Understanding [Command-Query separation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command%E2%80%93query_separation) as a principle making code easier to read and comprehend.

## Lesson Two

## Lesson Three

tolerance

## Lesson Four: Separation 

## Lesson Five: Open/Closed

## Lesson Six: Liskov

## Lesson Seven: Interface Segregation

## Lesson Eight: Dependency Inversion
